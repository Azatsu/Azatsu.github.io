## Informations

{: style="margin-left: 1.5em;" }
This project has been made as a 2nd year student project. \
Developing an engine by our own has helped us to better understand how are working bigger games engines like Unreal Engine or Unity, trying to reproduce them. \
Our team focused on developing as most features as possible thanks to an easily modulable ECS. \
I personally worked on the engine's and projects UI and on a few ECS modules like the audio engine (OpenAL) or the particle system. \
The group was made of 4 developers and 1 mentor ([Maxime Rouffet](https://github.com/mrouffet)) who gave us pieces of advice during the production which lasted 5 months.

## Features
- Launcher / Project Management
- Multithreaded Assets loading
- Custom threads
- Compute shaders (texture Generation / modification)
- Particles
- Extensive UI
- C++ Script Compilation and HotReload
- In editor shader edition
- Spatialized audio
- Packaging into a standalone game
- Shader reflection
- Script reflection / serialization
- And More â€¦
