## Informations

{: style="margin-left: 1.5em" }
Flood is a school project made during my 3rd year at Isart Digital. The objective was to discover the Tech Artist profession in relation with the Game Artists. We chose the Flood theme and our target was to create a realistic scene representing a flood in a cave. \
This was a really interesting project as it was the first time I worked with Game Artists for more than a game jam. \
It lasted 1 month and I mainly worked on all the in-scene interactions and linked some tools together. 

## Specificities
- Realistic artistic direction
- Movable camera with zoom in/out
- Openable and closable windows to let the flood in or not
- Actionable water pump to empty the cave
- Draggable objects depending on the rotation of the camera
- Buoyant objects
- Moss and rust on the objects depending on how much they've been immersed or emerged
- Randomly moving fish depending on the water volume
