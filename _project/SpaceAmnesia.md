## Informations

{: style="margin-left: 1.5em" }
Space Amnesia is a narrative game made during a game jam which lasted 48 hours. \
The game jam was the [Scientific Game Jam 2020](https://www.scientificgamejam.org/), a french game jam aiming at helping researchers representing their doctorate by a game. \
My group's researcher was Raphaël Chevasson, who wrote a thesis about deep learning. We were 1 researchers, 1 game designer, 1 artist, 1 sound designer and 2 devs. \
 \
The common thread was about an incident that just happened and there's *(probably..?)* only you and the spaceship's AI. \
Interact with some objects and have a discussion with the AI to find the right word in each room to learn more about this incident. \
 \
The other dev ([Guillaume Lefebvre](https://guillaumelbf.github.io/)) and me, mainly worked on putting together all the others works and developped a whole system based on a .csv for the discussions which sometimes were generated randomly. \
 \
 \
The game's available on [Itch.io](https://sniapok.itch.io/space-amnesia).
