## Informations

{: style="margin-left: 1.5em" }
Bellator is my 2nd game made with game designers at ISART which lasted 1 month. \
Begun at the beginning of my 2nd year as Game Programmer, it has been a really interesting and challenging project as we only used UE4 for the first time 3 weeks earlier. \
I discovered how much fighting games could be complex to develop, taking all weapons and attacks into account. \
Due to that fact, I witnessed how solid architectures were helping a lot in games development. \
My main work on this project has been to implement all the map relative interactions, the UI and the player's features. \
 \
Thanks to the architecture elaborated with [Ryan Sandrin](https://rytt0001.github.io/), the map interactions were easy to implement, directly affecting the entity. \
All the player's skills and features were directly bound to the UI, making me discover deeper UE4 as we had a killing combo system affecting the sounds and a rage gauge.

## Specificities
- Already given graphic assets
- 3 different maps with multiple waves
- Healing bonuses in the map
- Weapons spawning randomly in the map
- Fighting system with 3 weapons having strengths and weaknesses
- Throwable weapons
- Stagger & stun effects
