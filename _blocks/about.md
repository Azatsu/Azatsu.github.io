Hi! 
I'm Antonin Galliot, a French game developer in the graduation year at [ISART Digital](https://www.isart.com/). \
Since my youth, I always liked solving mathematical and algorithmic problems. \
 \
As of I reached middle school, I have begun developing programs as I joined the robotics club and had been in charge of automatizing our robot for a tournament. 
I particularly loved it and even though it was nodal programmation, I knew from this point that I'd work in this field of work. \
 \
Once I reached high school, I discovered video games at the same time as I discovered the pre-compiling and interpreting language Python. It only strengthened my desire to work as a developer. I even participated 3 times to a French algorithmic tournament and reached twice the semi-finals. \
At the end of my high school years, I decided to bind my passion for video games and programmation to join ISART Digital. \
During those 4 years, I discovered some of the video games development specializations and felt that I especially liked creating tools for the other professions. \
